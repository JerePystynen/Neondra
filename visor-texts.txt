Some texts to display on the visor:
Some of the texts are actual YouTube comments made
by real human beings I have saved for some reason
and some are obscure references or self-deprecation.

People should probably help by coming up with clever and
funny lines that can then be displayed on the visor.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Master Chief in the soda? I thought not. It‚Äôs not a story the Sangheili would tell you. It‚Äôs a UNSC legend. Master Cheif was a Spartan of the UNSC, so powerful and so wise he could use the soda to influence the RNA to create life‚Ä¶ He had such a knowledge of the soda that he could even keep the ones he cared about from being put in the soda. The soda is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was being put in the soda, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice put him in the soda in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from being put in the soda, but not himself.

Over 10000 people die each year from rage-induced strokes. Don't take this so seriously.
We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says:
Hey look buddy. I'm an Guitar Hero Pro, that means im really good at Guitar Hero. Not good as getting songs, because i like to play Slow Ride or Surfing with The Alien. For instance. How am i going to stop some big mean braindead nerd of beating me in Guitar Hero. The answer. Use skill, and if that dont work, use more skill.
We may dream of Past Futures, Wishful Thinking flooding our minds. We might try to Slip Away to The Pink Fields, but The Things We've Seen will never be forgotten. As I lay Sleepless on the bed, my Clockwork Hearts are still full of Reprise. After all, it's Your Own Way That Makes One.

She tries to train trains as per her own train training training, but her own train training wasn't very good so she can't train trains well, so instead of training trains with train training... She opens gaps in front of them at random.
We know that advanced economies with stable governments that borrow in their own currency are capable of running up very high levels of debt without crisis.
History shows that where ethics and economics come in conflict, victory is always with economics. Vested interests have never been known to have willingly divested themselves unless there was sufficient force to compel them.
In economics, the majority is always wrong.
In today's information-driven economy, business and scientific talent constrains growth.

1. It's better to start higher than lower. People will be a lot happier when you change it if its a price drop rather than a price increase. Also, people associate low prices with bad games.
2. Control the comparison. So that customers don't compare your game with other games of similar price and potentially choose the other game, create two options (ie game vs game + soundtrack) and price the second one rather high so that customers compare those options instead of comparing your game to another game. The customer will see that your base game is really cheap compared to the more expensive option and will be more likely to buy it.
3. When is doubt, test. Offer different prices in different advertisements and track the engagement relatative to the price.
